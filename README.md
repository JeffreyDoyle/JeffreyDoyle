# Hi! 👋😎 I'm Jeff

#### I'm a Software Engineer currently based out of beautiful British Columbia Canada 🇨🇦. 

- 🔭 I'm currently working on the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk) for [Flow](https://www.onflow.org/), an all new blockchain built to power next-gen games, apps and the developers who build them.

- 👨‍💻 I love JavaScript, and i'm also learning Go!

- 💪 I'm getting ready to release an app I built myself over the past year, stay tuned!

- 📫 Want to get in touch? Shoot me an email at jeffreydoylec@gmail.com or add me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-doyle/

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Puns. Thats why my favourite node type in the Flow blockchain is the Flexecution node! Just kidding! Theres no such thing as a Flexecution node, it's really called the Execution node. Didn't like that pun? I'm sure it will groan on you over time 😎.
